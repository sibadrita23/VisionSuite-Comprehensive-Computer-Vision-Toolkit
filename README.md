# VisionSuite-Comprehensive-Computer-Vision-Toolkit
# Computer Vision Model with CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the **CIFAR-10** dataset. It includes model training and visualization of predictions using high-definition images.

## Project Structure
- `model_training.py`: Code to train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- `predict_and_visualize.py`: Code for predictions and displaying images in HD quality.
- `/data`: Contains training and test data (if locally available).
- `/output`: Stores the high-quality output predictions image.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
